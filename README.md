## :dvd: Data 

Datasets are too heavy to upload on github.I created a [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KBoXwBufU_VywPt3oCleIUU0vH_BYOso?usp=sharing) on Google Drive to store them.


## ðŸ“š Trans people analysis using stack overflow survey dataset

A data-driven culture translates data into actions in the world. For data, I have chosen the dataset from stack overflow survey as provider. Also I am using the trans community as my persona.

I have used the [Stack Overflow Survey Dataset](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) to deeply analyze and bring insights about trans people in the IT community.

I will answer these questions below:

1. How has the number of trans people identified in the survey changed in the past three years?
2. What are the top and bottom countries by number of trans people?
3. What is the current situation with programming skills by trans people?

I have merged all datasets from 2019, 2020 and 2021 and created a new dataset with the common columns. After that I have separated the main columns:

- Trans (Yes, No, Prefer not to say)
- Country (United States, Brazil, Netherlands, etc.)
- yearData (2019,2020 or 2021)
- mainBranch (Current situation with programming skills)

I've developed an interesting to answer these questions. You can play with it here:
